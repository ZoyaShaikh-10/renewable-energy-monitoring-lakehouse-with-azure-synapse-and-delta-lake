## Project Workflow

- **Data Sources → ADLS (Raw Zone) :**
    -   Raw data from real-time and batch is ingested into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 in the Raw Zone.

-   **Delta Lake (Raw Data Storage):**
    -   Raw data is stored in Delta Lake for reliability, versioning, and easy accessibility.

-   **Processing (Databricks) → Delta Lake (Processed Zone):**

    -   Data is cleaned, transformed, and aggregated in Azure Databricks. Processed data is stored back into Delta Lake in the Processed Zone with optimized partitioning for analytics.

- **Analytics (Synapse Analytics):**

    -   Azure Synapse Analytics connects to the Processed Zone of Delta Lake, enabling SQL-based querying, advanced analytics, and data preparation for reporting.

-   **Visualization (Power BI or Synapse Studio)**
    -   Insights and trends are visualized using Power BI dashboards or quick visualizations in Synapse Studio for decision-making.

This workflow ensures a streamlined approach from data ingestion to actionable insights, leveraging the power of Azure's ecosystem.

## Project Workflow

**Data Collection:**

-   Source: Energy consumption and production data is gathered from multiple sources such as APIs, CSV files, and databases.
-   Data Types: Data includes energy usage statistics, grid production levels, and renewable energy generation data.

**Data Ingestion:**

-   Real-Time Data: Energy consumption/production data is ingested in real-time using Azure Event Hub.
-   Batch Data: Historical or periodic data is stored in Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2).

**Data Staging and Storage:**

-   Raw data from both real-time and batch sources is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2).
-   The data is organized and optimized for processing and analytics.

**Data Processing:**

-   Azure Synapse Analytics is used to perform large-scale queries, transformations, and aggregations.

**Data Cleansing and Transformation:**

-   The raw data is cleaned and transformed into a format that can be easily analyzed (e.g., aggregating energy production, removing duplicates, handling missing values).
Delta Lake provides an ACID-compliant layer for data reliability, supporting time travel and versioning.
Data Storage in Delta Lake:

-   Cleaned and processed data is stored in Delta Lake on Azure Data Lake Storage to ensure data quality, reliability, and the ability to run analytics queries efficiently.

**Data Analysis and Querying:**

-   Use Azure Synapse Analytics to query the processed data for deeper insights (e.g., trends in renewable energy usage, analysis of production and consumption).
-   Run aggregate queries to determine key insights like peak renewable energy production times, energy usage efficiency, etc.

**Data Visualization and Reporting:**

-   Visualize the results using Power BI or Azure Synapse Studio.
-   Create dashboards and reports that provide insights into renewable energy consumption, production trends, and operational efficiencies.

**End-User Interaction:**

-   Reports and dashboards are accessible to stakeholders (e.g., energy analysts, business leaders) for informed decision-making.


**Iterative Improvement:**

The system continuously ingests new data, processes it, and updates the reports, ensuring that the analytics remain up-to-date for stakeholders.
